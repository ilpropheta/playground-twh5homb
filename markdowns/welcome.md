# Welcome!

This C++ template lets you get started quickly with a simple working example using CMake/GCC. If it is your first contribution then you should have a look at the [Getting Started](https://tech.io/doc/getting-started-create-playground) document.


The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/TechDotIO/cpp-template), please feel free to come up with proposals to improve it.
